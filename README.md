# Consecutive-Lane-Merging
The code is implemented base on the algorithm 2 from https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9304813
* "testbench.py" is used to generate the result.
* "poisson.py" is used to generate the testdata i.e. the arrival time of vehicles.
* "greedy.py" applies the First-Arrive-First-Go approach twice.
* "dynamic.py" implements the approach from the paper.
* "result.csv" contains the experiment result by running "testbench.py"
